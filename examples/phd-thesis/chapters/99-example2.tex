\section{Addressing the Research Questions}
\label{sec:example2.rq}

In this section we take a look back at the \hyperref[sec:example.rq]{research questions} that we defined in Chapter \ref{chap:example} and discuss our findings.

% ** SUBSECTION **
\subsection*{\ref{rq:diplomatic} (Non-coercive Diplomatic Frameworks)}
\label{subsec:example2.rq:diplomatic}

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``\RQDiplomatic''}
\end{quote}

Honestly, diplomacy is just too good for some civilisations.  And sometimes a bit of coercion is necessary.

\paragraph*{Hypothesis \ref{hyp:diplomatic.first}:} \textit{\HDiplomaticA}

Data showed that sometimes it doesn't matter how much cultural exchange you have, there will still be someone that doesn't want to get along.

\paragraph*{Hypothesis \ref{hyp:diplomatic.second}:} \textit{\HDiplomaticB}

We found that in some cases the technological uplift should probably be delayed indefinitely until they can learn to play nicely.


% ** SUBSECTION **
\subsection*{\ref{rq:minds} (AI Mediators)}
\label{subsec:example2.rq:minds}

\begin{quote}
	\textit{``\RQMinds''}
\end{quote}

After careful consideration, we concluded that it's usually probably best just to leave it all to the Minds, because they will likely end up running things their own way in the end.

\paragraph*{Hypothesis \ref{hyp:minds.first}:} \textit{\HMindsA}

We found a couple of Minds that had absolutely no interest in maintaining trust and legitimacy, so we should probably bear that in mind when asking any to get involved.

\paragraph*{Hypothesis \ref{hyp:minds.second}:} \textit{\HMindsB}

Data showed that most people did not want to be on the receiving end of ``utilitarian strategies''.  We don't blame them.
